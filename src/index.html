    <h3>A little about me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi I’m Beth, a social media consultant based in Manchester, UK. I have
      been working in social media marketing for the last five years, and have
      gained a tonne of skills and knowledge along the way. Adapting from
      business to business, and telling their story through the power of social
      media is something I am incredibly passionate about and love to do. There
      is no account too big or too small, I enjoy working my magic on them all!
